	
Write 2 c programs, A and B. A will create 2 prcesses p1 and p2. p1 will
have provided (by any means (necessary)) a file containing only numbers (as
many as you like) then it will read from the standard input (keyboard)
a number (n). p1 will send the first n numbers from the file to p2 via pipe.
p2 will send the sum of al the odd numbers received to B, via fifo.
B will display on the standard output (the console) the number received.
The source file must be compiled using gcc with -Wall -g options WITHOUT WARNINGS OR SYNTAX ERRORS!!!
Memory leacks and zombie processes are not allowed.



A-> -pipe and fifo
	-gets file name
	-tries to open it
	-creates fifo
	-and then creates pipe!
	-and then fork
	in p1: reads the first n numbers from the file and writes them to p2
		-> cat timp n>0 si not at feof(file). Also sends first n and how many numbers were sent
	in p2: sends sum of odd numbers to B
		 -> cat timp n-leftover
B-> only prints out
